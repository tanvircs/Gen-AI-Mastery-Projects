Introduction\\n\\nReal-time object detection is a very important topic in computer vision, as it is often a necessary component in computer vision systems. For example, multi-object track- ing [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58], medical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de- vices that execute real-time object detection is usually some mobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing units (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam- ple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute stick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU (Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI processing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are all NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus on speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu- tion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa- per, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes that it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from the edge to the cloud.\\n\\nopment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on producing low-power single-chip and improving the infer- ence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX [21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer- ence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop- ment of real-time object detector has focused on the de- sign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de- tectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de- sign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet [92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time object detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they mostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and then use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec- ture. The development direction of the proposed methods in this paper are different from that of the current mainstream real-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op- timization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti- mization of the training process. Our focus will be on some optimized modules and optimization methods which may strengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of object detection, but without increasing the inference cost. We call the proposed modules and optimization methods trainable bag-of-freebies.\\n\\nIn recent years, the real-time object detector is still de- veloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-\\n\\n1\\n\\nRecently, model re-parameterization [13, 12, 29] and dy- namic label assignment [20, 17, 42] have become important topics in network training and object detection. Mainly af- ter the above new concepts are proposed, the training of object detector evolves many new issues. In this paper, we will present some of the new issues we have discovered and devise effective methods to address them. For model re- parameterization, we analyze the model re-parameterization strategies applicable to layers in different networks with the concept of gradient propagation path, and propose planned re-parameterized model. In addition, when we discover that with dynamic label assignment technology, the training of model with multiple output layers will generate new issues. That is: “How to assign dynamic targets for the outputs of different branches?” For this problem, we propose a new label assignment method called coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided label assignment.\\n\\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as fol- lows: (1) we design several trainable bag-of-freebies meth- ods, so that real-time object detection can greatly improve the detection accuracy without increasing the inference cost; (2) for the evolution of object detection methods, we found two new issues, namely how re-parameterized mod- ule replaces original module, and how dynamic label as- signment strategy deals with assignment to different output layers. In addition, we also propose methods to address the difﬁculties arising from these issues; (3) we propose “ex- tend” and “compound scaling” methods for the real-time object detector that can effectively utilize parameters and computation; and (4) the method we proposed can effec- tively reduce about 40% parameters and 50% computation of state-of-the-art real-time object detector, and has faster inference speed and higher detection accuracy.\\n\\n2. Related work\\n\\n2.1. Real-time object detectors\\n\\nCurrently state-of-the-art real-time object detectors are mainly based on YOLO [61, 62, 63] and FCOS [76, 77], which are [3, 79, 81, 21, 54, 85, 23]. Being able to become a state-of-the-art real-time object detector usually requires the following characteristics: (1) a faster and stronger net- work architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration method [22, 97, 37, 74, 59, 30, 9, 45]; (3) a more accurate detection method [76, 77, 69]; (4) a more robust loss func- tion [96, 64, 6, 56, 95, 57]; (5) a more efﬁcient label assign- ment method [99, 20, 17, 82, 42]; and (6) a more efﬁcient training method. In this paper, we do not intend to explore self-supervised learning or knowledge distillation methods that require additional data or large model. Instead, we will design new trainable bag-of-freebies method for the issues derived from the state-of-the-art methods associated with (4), (5), and (6) mentioned above.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2.2. Model re-parameterization\\n\\nModel re-parametrization techniques [71, 31, 75, 19, 33, 11, 4, 24, 13, 12, 10, 29, 14, 78] merge multiple compu- tational modules into one at inference stage. The model re-parameterization technique can be regarded as an en- semble technique, and we can divide it into two cate- gories, i.e., module-level ensemble and model-level ensem- ble. There are two common practices for model-level re- parameterization to obtain the ﬁnal inference model. One is to train multiple identical models with different train- ing data, and then average the weights of multiple trained models. The other is to perform a weighted average of the weights of models at different iteration number. Module- level re-parameterization is a more popular research issue recently. This type of method splits a module into multi- ple identical or different module branches during training and integrates multiple branched modules into a completely equivalent module during inference. However, not all pro- posed re-parameterized module can be perfectly applied to different architectures. With this in mind, we have devel- oped new re-parameterization module and designed related application strategies for various architectures.\\n\\n2.3. Model scaling\\n\\nModel scaling [72, 60, 74, 73, 15, 16, 2, 51] is a way to scale up or down an already designed model and make it ﬁt in different computing devices. The model scaling method usually uses different scaling factors, such as reso- lution (size of input image), depth (number of layer), width (number of channel), and stage (number of feature pyra- mid), so as to achieve a good trade-off for the amount of network parameters, computation, inference speed, and ac- curacy. Network architecture search (NAS) is one of the commonly used model scaling methods. NAS can automat- ically search for suitable scaling factors from search space without deﬁning too complicated rules. The disadvantage of NAS is that it requires very expensive computation to complete the search for model scaling factors. In [15], the researcher analyzes the relationship between scaling factors and the amount of parameters and operations, trying to di- rectly estimate some rules, and thereby obtain the scaling factors required by model scaling. Checking the literature, we found that almost all model scaling methods analyze in- dividual scaling factor independently, and even the methods in the compound scaling category also optimized scaling factor independently. The reason for this is because most popular NAS architectures deal with scaling factors that are not very correlated. We observed that all concatenation- based models, such as DenseNet [32] or VoVNet [39], will change the input width of some layers when the depth of such models is scaled. Since the proposed architecture is concatenation-based, we have to design a new compound scaling method for this model.\\n\\nFigure 2: Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks. The proposed extended ELAN (E-ELAN) does not change the gradient transmis- sion path of the original architecture at all, but use group convolution to increase the cardinality of the added features, and combine the features of different groups in a shufﬂe and merge cardinality manner. This way of operation can enhance the features learned by different feature maps and improve the use of parameters and calculations.\\n\\n3. Architecture\\n\\n3.1. Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks\\n\\nIn most of the literature on designing the efﬁcient ar- chitectures, the main considerations are no more than the number of parameters, the amount of computation, and the computational density. Starting from the characteristics of memory access cost, Ma et al. [55] also analyzed the in- ﬂuence of the input/output channel ratio, the number of branches of the architecture, and the element-wise opera- tion on the network inference speed. Doll´ar et al. [15] addi- tionally considered activation when performing model scal- ing, that is, to put more consideration on the number of el- ements in the output tensors of convolutional layers. The design of CSPVoVNet [79] in Figure 2 (b) is a variation of VoVNet [39]. In addition to considering the aforementioned basic designing concerns, the architecture of CSPVoVNet [79] also analyzes the gradient path, in order to enable the weights of different layers to learn more diverse features. The gradient analysis approach described above makes in- ferences faster and more accurate. ELAN [1] in Figure 2 (c) considers the following design strategy – “How to design an efﬁcient network?.” They came out with a conclusion: By controlling the shortest longest gradient path, a deeper net- work can learn and converge effectively. In this paper, we propose Extended-ELAN (E-ELAN) based on ELAN and its main architecture is shown in Figure 2 (d).\\n\\nRegardless of the gradient path length and the stacking number of computational blocks in large-scale ELAN, it has If more computational blocks are reached a stable state. stacked unlimitedly, this stable state may be destroyed, and the parameter utilization rate will decrease. The proposed\\n\\nE-ELAN uses expand, shufﬂe, merge cardinality to achieve the ability to continuously enhance the learning ability of the network without destroying the original gradient path. In terms of architecture, E-ELAN only changes the archi- tecture in computational block, while the architecture of transition layer is completely unchanged. Our strategy is to use group convolution to expand the channel and car- dinality of computational blocks. We will apply the same group parameter and channel multiplier to all the compu- tational blocks of a computational layer. Then, the feature map calculated by each computational block will be shuf- ﬂed into g groups according to the set group parameter g, and then concatenate them together. At this time, the num- ber of channels in each group of feature map will be the same as the number of channels in the original architec- ture. Finally, we add g groups of feature maps to perform merge cardinality. In addition to maintaining the original ELAN design architecture, E-ELAN can also guide differ- ent groups of computational blocks to learn more diverse features.\\n\\n3.2. Model scaling for concatenation-based models\\n\\nThe main purpose of model scaling is to adjust some at- tributes of the model and generate models of different scales to meet the needs of different inference speeds. For ex- ample the scaling model of EfﬁcientNet [72] considers the width, depth, and resolution. As for the scaled-YOLOv4 [79], its scaling model is to adjust the number of stages. In [15], Doll´ar et al. analyzed the inﬂuence of vanilla convolu- tion and group convolution on the amount of parameter and computation when performing width and depth scaling, and used this to design the corresponding model scaling method.\\n\\n3\\n\\nFigure 3: Model scaling for concatenation-based models. From (a) to (b), we observe that when depth scaling is performed on concatenation-based models, the output width of a computational block also increases. This phenomenon will cause the input width of the subsequent transmission layer to increase. Therefore, we propose (c), that is, when performing model scaling on concatenation- based models, only the depth in a computational block needs to be scaled, and the remaining of transmission layer is performed with corresponding width scaling.\\n\\nThe above methods are mainly used in architectures such as PlainNet or ResNet. When these architectures are in execut- ing scaling up or scaling down, the in-degree and out-degree of each layer will not change, so we can independently an- alyze the impact of each scaling factor on the amount of parameters and computation. However, if these methods are applied to the concatenation-based architecture, we will ﬁnd that when scaling up or scaling down is performed on depth, the in-degree of a translation layer which is immedi- ately after a concatenation-based computational block will decrease or increase, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b).\\n\\nIt can be inferred from the above phenomenon that we cannot analyze different scaling factors separately for a concatenation-based model but must be considered to- gether. Take scaling-up depth as an example, such an ac- tion will cause a ratio change between the input channel and output channel of a transition layer, which may lead to a de- crease in the hardware usage of the model. Therefore, we must propose the corresponding compound model scaling method for a concatenation-based model. When we scale the depth factor of a computational block, we must also cal- culate the change of the output channel of that block. Then, we will perform width factor scaling with the same amount of change on the transition layers, and the result is shown in Figure 3 (c). Our proposed compound scaling method can maintain the properties that the model had at the initial design and maintains the optimal structure.\\n\\n4. Trainable bag-of-freebies\\n\\n4.1. Planned re-parameterized convolution\\n\\nAlthough RepConv [13] has achieved excellent perfor- mance on the VGG [68], when we directly apply it to ResNet [26] and DenseNet [32] and other architectures, its accuracy will be signiﬁcantly reduced. We use gradi- ent ﬂow propagation paths to analyze how re-parameterized convolution should be combined with different network. We also designed planned re-parameterized convolution ac- cordingly.\\n\\nIn the proposed Figure 4: Planned re-parameterized model. planned re-parameterized model, we found that a layer with resid- ual or concatenation connections, its RepConv should not have identity connection. Under these circumstances, it can be replaced by RepConvN that contains no identity connections.\\n\\nRepConv actually combines 3 × 3 convolution, 1 × 1 convolution, and identity connection in one convolutional layer. After analyzing the combination and correspond- ing performance of RepConv and different architectures, we ﬁnd that the identity connection in RepConv destroys the residual in ResNet and the concatenation in DenseNet, which provides more diversity of gradients for different fea- ture maps. For the above reasons, we use RepConv with- out identity connection (RepConvN) to design the architec- ture of planned re-parameterized convolution. In our think- ing, when a convolutional layer with residual or concate- nation is replaced by re-parameterized convolution, there should be no identity connection. Figure 4 shows an exam- ple of our designed “planned re-parameterized convolution” used in PlainNet and ResNet. As for the complete planned re-parameterized convolution experiment in residual-based model and concatenation-based model, it will be presented in the ablation study session.\\n\\n4\\n\\nFigure 5: Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead head label assigner. Compare with normal model (a), the schema in (b) has auxiliary head. Different from the usual independent label assigner (c), we propose (d) lead head guided label assigner and (e) coarse-to-ﬁne lead head guided label assigner. The proposed label assigner is optimized by lead head prediction and the ground truth to get the labels of training lead head and auxiliary head at the same time. The detailed coarse-to-ﬁne implementation method and constraint design details will be elaborated in Apendix.\\n\\n4.2. Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead loss\\n\\nDeep supervision [38] is a technique that is often used in training deep networks. Its main concept is to add extra auxiliary head in the middle layers of the network, and the shallow network weights with assistant loss as the guide. Even for architectures such as ResNet [26] and DenseNet [32] which usually converge well, deep supervi- sion [70, 98, 67, 47, 82, 65, 86, 50] can still signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the model on many tasks. Fig- ure 5 (a) and (b) show, respectively, the object detector ar- chitecture “without” and “with” deep supervision. In this paper, we call the head responsible for the ﬁnal output as the lead head, and the head used to assist training is called auxiliary head.\\n\\nNext we want to discuss the issue of label assignment. In the past, in the training of deep network, label assignment usually refers directly to the ground truth and generate hard label according to the given rules. However, in recent years, if we take object detection as an example, researchers often use the quality and distribution of prediction output by the network, and then consider together with the ground truth to use some calculation and optimization methods to generate a reliable soft label [61, 8, 36, 99, 91, 44, 43, 90, 20, 17, 42]. For example, YOLO [61] use IoU of prediction of bounding box regression and ground truth as the soft label of object- ness. In this paper, we call the mechanism that considers the network prediction results together with the ground truth and then assigns soft labels as “label assigner.”\\n\\nDeep supervision needs to be trained on the target ob- jectives regardless of the circumstances of auxiliary head or lead head. During the development of soft label assigner re- lated techniques, we accidentally discovered a new deriva- tive issue, i.e., “How to assign soft label to auxiliary head and lead head ?” To the best of our knowledge, the relevant literature has not explored this issue so far. The results of the most popular method at present is as shown in Figure 5 (c), which is to separate auxiliary head and lead head, and then use their own prediction results and the ground truth\\n\\nto execute label assignment. The method proposed in this paper is a new label assignment method that guides both auxiliary head and lead head by the lead head prediction. In other words, we use lead head prediction as guidance to generate coarse-to-ﬁne hierarchical labels, which are used for auxiliary head and lead head learning, respectively. The two proposed deep supervision label assignment strategies are shown in Figure 5 (d) and (e), respectively.\\n\\nLead head guided label assigner is mainly calculated based on the prediction result of the lead head and the ground truth, and generate soft label through the optimiza- tion process. This set of soft labels will be used as the tar- get training model for both auxiliary head and lead head. The reason to do this is because lead head has a relatively strong learning capability, so the soft label generated from it should be more representative of the distribution and corre- lation between the source data and the target. Furthermore, we can view such learning as a kind of generalized residual learning. By letting the shallower auxiliary head directly learn the information that lead head has learned, lead head will be more able to focus on learning residual information that has not yet been learned.\\n\\nCoarse-to-ﬁne lead head guided label assigner also used the predicted result of the lead head and the ground truth to generate soft label. However, in the process we gen- erate two different sets of soft label, i.e., coarse label and ﬁne label, where ﬁne label is the same as the soft label gen- erated by lead head guided label assigner, and coarse label is generated by allowing more grids to be treated as posi- tive target by relaxing the constraints of the positive sample assignment process. The reason for this is that the learning ability of an auxiliary head is not as strong as that of a lead head, and in order to avoid losing the information that needs to be learned, we will focus on optimizing the recall of aux- iliary head in the object detection task. As for the output of lead head, we can ﬁlter the high precision results from the high recall results as the ﬁnal output. However, we must note that if the additional weight of coarse label is close to\\n\\n5\\n\\nTable 1: Comparison of baseline object detectors.\\n\\nModel\\n\\n#Param.\\n\\nFLOPs\\n\\nSize\\n\\nAPval\\n\\nAPval 50\\n\\nAPval 75\\n\\nAPval S\\n\\nAPval M\\n\\nAPval L\\n\\nYOLOv4 [3] YOLOR-u5 (r6.1) [81] YOLOv4-CSP [79] YOLOR-CSP [81] YOLOv7 improvement\\n\\n64.4M 46.5M 52.9M 52.9M 36.9M -43%\\n\\n142.8G 109.1G 120.4G 120.4G 104.7G -15%\\n\\n640 640 640 640 640 -\\n\\n49.7% 63.7% 50.2% 63.7% 50.3% 65.1% 65.4% 50.8% 51.2% 69.7% 55.5% 35.2% 56.0% 66.7% +1.3 +0.4\\n\\n68.2% 68.7% 68.6% 69.5%\\n\\n54.3% 54.6% 54.9% 55.3%\\n\\n32.9% 33.2% 34.2% 33.7%\\n\\n54.8% 55.5% 55.6% 56.0%\\n\\n+0.2\\n\\n+0.2\\n\\n+1.5\\n\\n=\\n\\nYOLOR-CSP-X [81] YOLOv7-X improvement\\n\\n96.9M 71.3M -36%\\n\\n226.8G 189.9G -19%\\n\\n640 640 -\\n\\n52.7% 71.3% 57.4% 68.3% 52.9% 71.1% 57.5% 36.9% 57.7% 68.6% +0.3 +0.2\\n\\n36.3%\\n\\n57.5%\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n+0.1\\n\\n+0.6\\n\\n+0.2\\n\\nYOLOv4-tiny [79] YOLOv7-tiny improvement\\n\\n6.1 6.2 +2%\\n\\n6.9 5.8 -19%\\n\\n416 416 -\\n\\n24.9% 39.2% 35.2% 52.8% 37.3% 15.7% 38.0% 53.4% +14.2 +10.3\\n\\n42.1%\\n\\n25.7%\\n\\n8.7%\\n\\n28.4%\\n\\n+10.7\\n\\n+11.6\\n\\n+7.0\\n\\n+9.6\\n\\nYOLOv4-tiny-3l [79] YOLOv7-tiny improvement\\n\\n8.7 6.2 -39%\\n\\n5.2 3.5 -49%\\n\\n320 320 -\\n\\n51.5% 30.8% 30.8% 47.3% 32.2% 10.0% 31.9% 52.2% +0.7\\n\\n47.3%\\n\\n32.2% 10.9% 31.9%\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n=\\n\\nYOLOR-E6 [81] YOLOv7-E6 improvement\\n\\n115.8M 97.2M -19%\\n\\n683.2G 515.2G -33%\\n\\n1280 1280 -\\n\\n40.1% 60.4% 69.2% 55.7% 55.9% 73.5% 61.1% 40.6% 60.3% 70.0% +0.8 +0.2\\n\\n73.2%\\n\\n60.7%\\n\\n+0.3\\n\\n+0.4\\n\\n+0.5\\n\\n0.1\\n\\nYOLOR-D6 [81] YOLOv7-D6 YOLOv7-E6E improvement\\n\\n151.7M 154.7M 151.7M =\\n\\n935.6G 806.8G 843.2G -11%\\n\\n1280 1280 1280 -\\n\\n69.9% 56.1% 56.3% 70.1% 56.8% 74.4% 62.1% 40.8% 62.1% 70.6% +0.7 +0.7\\n\\n73.9% 73.8%\\n\\n61.2% 42.4% 60.5% 60.6% 41.3% 61.4%\\n\\n+0.5\\n\\n+0.9\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n+1.6\\n\\nthat of ﬁne label, it may produce bad prior at ﬁnal predic- tion. Therefore, in order to make those extra coarse positive grids have less impact, we put restrictions in the decoder, so that the extra coarse positive grids cannot produce soft label perfectly. The mechanism mentioned above allows the importance of ﬁne label and coarse label to be dynam- ically adjusted during the learning process, and makes the optimizable upper bound of ﬁne label always higher than coarse label.\\n\\n4.3.

All our experi- ments did not use pre-trained models. That is, all models were trained from scratch. During the development pro- cess, we used train 2017 set for training, and then used val 2017 set for veriﬁcation and choosing hyperparameters. Fi- nally, we show the performance of object detection on the test 2017 set and compare it with the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Detailed training parameter settings are described in Appendix.\\n\\nlist some trainable bag-of- freebies. These freebies are some of the tricks we used in training, but the original concepts were not proposed by us. The training details of these freebies will be elab- orated in the Appendix, including (1) Batch normalization in conv-bn-activation topology: This part mainly connects batch normalization layer directly to convolutional layer. The purpose of this is to integrate the mean and variance of batch normalization into the bias and weight of convolu- tional layer at the inference stage. (2) Implicit knowledge in YOLOR [81] combined with convolution feature map in addition and multiplication manner: Implicit knowledge in YOLOR can be simpliﬁed to a vector by pre-computing at the inference stage. This vector can be combined with the bias and weight of the previous or subsequent convolutional layer. (3) EMA model: EMA is a technique used in mean teacher [75], and in our system we use EMA model purely as the ﬁnal inference model.\\n\\nIn this section we will\\n\\nWe designed basic model for edge GPU, normal GPU, and cloud GPU, and they are respectively called YOLOv7- tiny, YOLOv7, and YOLOv7-W6. At the same time, we also use basic model for model scaling for different ser- vice requirements and get different types of models. For YOLOv7, we do stack scaling on neck, and use the pro- posed compound scaling method to perform scaling-up of the depth and width of the entire model, and use this to ob- tain YOLOv7-X. As for YOLOv7-W6, we use the newly proposed compound scaling method to obtain YOLOv7-E6 In addition, we use the proposed E- and YOLOv7-D6. ELAN for YOLOv7-E6, and thereby complete YOLOv7- E6E. Since YOLOv7-tiny is an edge GPU-oriented archi- tecture, it will use leaky ReLU as activation function. As for other models we use SiLU as activation function. We will describe the scaling factor of each model in detail in Appendix.\\n\\n6\\n\\nTable 2: Comparison of state-of-the-art real-time object detectors.\\n\\nModel\\n\\n#Param.\\n\\nFLOPs\\n\\nSize\\n\\nFPS\\n\\nAPtest / APval\\n\\nAPtest 50\\n\\nAPtest 75\\n\\nAPtest S\\n\\nAPtest M\\n\\nAPtest L\\n\\nYOLOX-S [21] YOLOX-M [21] YOLOX-L [21] YOLOX-X [21]\\n\\n9.0M 25.3M 54.2M 99.1M\\n\\n26.8G 73.8G 155.6G 281.9G\\n\\n640 640 640 640\\n\\n102 81 69 58\\n\\n40.5% / 40.5% 47.2% / 46.9% 50.1% / 49.7% 51.5% / 51.1%\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n- - -\\n\\nPPYOLOE-S [85] PPYOLOE-M [85] PPYOLOE-L [85] PPYOLOE-X [85]\\n\\n7.9M 23.4M 52.2M 98.4M\\n\\n17.4G 49.9G 110.1G 206.6G\\n\\n640 640 640 640\\n\\n208 123 78 45\\n\\n43.1% / 42.7% 48.9% / 48.6% 51.4% / 50.9% 52.2% / 51.9%\\n\\n60.5% 66.5% 68.9% 69.9%\\n\\n46.6% 53.0% 55.6% 56.5%\\n\\n23.2% 28.6% 31.4% 33.3%\\n\\n46.4% 52.9% 55.3% 56.3%\\n\\n56.9% 63.8% 66.1% 66.4%\\n\\nYOLOv5-N (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-S (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-M (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-L (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-X (r6.1) [23]\\n\\n1.9M 7.2M 21.2M 46.5M 86.7M\\n\\n4.5G 16.5G 49.0G 109.1G 205.7G\\n\\n640 640 640 640 640\\n\\n159 156 122 99 83\\n\\n/ 28.0% - / 37.4% - / 45.4% - / 49.0% - / 50.7%\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\nYOLOR-CSP [81] YOLOR-CSP-X [81]\\n\\n52.9M 96.9M\\n\\n120.4G 226.8G\\n\\n640 640\\n\\n106 87\\n\\n51.1% / 50.8% 53.0% / 52.7%\\n\\n69.6% 71.4%\\n\\n55.7% 57.9%\\n\\n31.7% 33.7%\\n\\n55.3% 57.1%\\n\\n64.7% 66.8%\\n\\nYOLOv7-tiny-SiLU YOLOv7 YOLOv7-X\\n\\n6.2M 36.9M 71.3M\\n\\n13.8G 104.7G 189.9G\\n\\n640 640 640\\n\\n286 161 114\\n\\n38.7% / 38.7% 51.4% / 51.2% 53.1% / 52.9%\\n\\n56.7% 69.7% 71.2%\\n\\n41.7% 55.9% 57.8%\\n\\n18.8% 31.8% 33.8%\\n\\n42.4% 55.5% 57.1%\\n\\n51.9% 65.0% 67.4%\\n\\nYOLOv5-N6 (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-S6 (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-M6 (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-L6 (r6.1) [23] YOLOv5-X6 (r6.1) [23]\\n\\n3.2M 12.6M 35.7M 76.8M 140.7M\\n\\n18.4G 67.2G 200.0G 445.6G 839.2G\\n\\n1280 1280 1280 1280 1280\\n\\n123 122 90 63 38\\n\\n/ 36.0% - / 44.8% - / 51.3% - / 53.7% - / 55.0%\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\n- - - -\\n\\nYOLOR-P6 [81] YOLOR-W6 [81] YOLOR-E6 [81] YOLOR-D6 [81]\\n\\n37.2M 79.8G 115.8M 151.7M\\n\\n325.6G 453.2G 683.2G 935.6G\\n\\n1280 1280 1280 1280\\n\\n76 66 45 34\\n\\n53.9% / 53.5% 55.2% / 54.8% 55.8% / 55.7% 56.5% / 56.1%\\n\\n71.4% 72.7% 73.4% 74.1%\\n\\n58.9% 60.5% 61.1% 61.9%\\n\\n36.1% 37.7% 38.4% 38.9%\\n\\n57.7% 59.1% 59.7% 60.4%\\n\\n65.6% 67.1% 67.7% 68.7%\\n\\nYOLOv7-W6 YOLOv7-E6 YOLOv7-D6 YOLOv7-E6E\\n\\n70.4M 97.2M 154.7M 151.7M\\n\\n360.0G 515.2G 806.8G 843.2G\\n\\n1280 1280 1280 1280\\n\\n84 56 44 36\\n\\n54.9% / 54.6% 56.0% / 55.9% 56.6% / 56.3% 56.8% / 56.8%\\n\\n72.6% 73.5% 74.0% 74.4%\\n\\n60.1% 61.2% 61.8% 62.1%\\n\\n37.3% 38.0% 38.8% 39.3%\\n\\n58.7% 59.9% 60.1% 60.5%\\n\\n67.1% 68.4% 69.5% 69.0%\\n\\n1 Our FLOPs is calaculated by rectangle input resolution like 640 × 640 or 1280 × 1280. 2 Our inference time is estimated by using letterbox resize input image to make its long side equals to 640 or 1280.\\n\\n5.2. Baselines\\n\\n5.3. Comparison with state-of-the-arts\\n\\nWe choose previous version of YOLO [3, 79] and state- of-the-art object detector YOLOR [81] as our baselines. Ta- ble 1 shows the comparison of our proposed YOLOv7 mod- els and those baseline that are trained with the same settings. From the results we see that if compared with YOLOv4, YOLOv7 has 75% less parameters, 36% less computation, and brings 1.5% higher AP. If compared with state-of-the- art YOLOR-CSP, YOLOv7 has 43% fewer parameters, 15% less computation, and 0.4% higher AP. In the performance of tiny model, compared with YOLOv4-tiny-31, YOLOv7- tiny reduces the number of parameters by 39% and the amount of computation by 49%, but maintains the same AP. On the cloud GPU model, our model can still have a higher AP while reducing the number of parameters by 19% and the amount of computation by 33%.\\n\\nWe compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art object detectors for general GPUs and Mobile GPUs, and the results are shown in Table 2. From the results in Table 2 we know that the proposed method has the best speed-accuracy trade-off comprehensively. If we compare YOLOv7-tiny-SiLU with YOLOv5-N (r6.1), our method is 127 fps faster and 10.7% more accurate on AP. In ad- dition, YOLOv7 has 51.4% AP at frame rate of 161 fps, while PPYOLOE-L with the same AP has only 78 fps frame rate. In terms of parameter usage, YOLOv7 is 41% less than PPYOLOE-L. If we compare YOLOv7-X with 114 fps in- ference speed to YOLOv5-L (r6.1) with 99 fps inference speed, YOLOv7-X can improve AP by 3.9%. If YOLOv7- X is compared with YOLOv5-X (r6.1) of similar scale, the inference speed of YOLOv7-X is 31 fps faster. In addi- tion, in terms of the amount of parameters and computation, YOLOv7-X reduces 22% of parameters and 8% of compu- tation compared to YOLOv5-X (r6.1), but improves AP by 2.2%.\\n\\n7\\n\\nIf we compare YOLOv7 with YOLOR using the input resolution 1280, the inference speed of YOLOv7-W6 is 8 fps faster than that of YOLOR-P6, and the detection rate is also increased by 1% AP. As for the comparison between YOLOv7-E6 and YOLOv5-X6 (r6.1), the former has 0.9% AP gain than the latter, 45% less parameters and 63% less computation, and the inference speed is increased by 47%. YOLOv7-D6 has close inference speed to YOLOR-E6, but improves AP by 0.8%. YOLOv7-E6E has close inference speed to YOLOR-D6, but improves AP by 0.3%.\\n\\n5.4. Ablation study\\n\\n5.4.1 Proposed compound scaling method\\n\\nTable 3 shows the results obtained when using different model scaling strategies for scaling up. Among them, our proposed compound scaling method is to scale up the depth of computational block by 1.5 times and the width of tran- sition block by 1.25 times. If our method is compared with the method that only scaled up the width, our method can improve the AP by 0.5% with less parameters and amount of computation. If our method is compared with the method that only scales up the depth, our method only needs to in- crease the number of parameters by 2.9% and the amount of computation by 1.2%, which can improve the AP by 0.2%. It can be seen from the results of Table 3 that our proposed compound scaling strategy can utilize parameters and com- putation more efﬁciently.\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation study on proposed model scaling.\\n\\n50 APval 75 base (v7-X light) 47.0M 125.5G 640 51.7% 70.1% 56.0% width only (1.25 w) 73.4M 195.5G 640 52.4% 70.9% 57.1% depth only (2.0 d) 69.3M 187.6G 640 52.7% 70.8% 57.3% 71.3M 189.9G 640 52.9% 71.1% 57.5% compound (v7-X) +1.5 improvement\\n\\n#Param.

Since the CSP- Darknet with dark block and reversed dark block has exactly the same amount of parameters and operations, it is fair to compare. The experiment results illustrated in Table 5 fully conﬁrm that the proposed planned re-parameterized model is equally effective on residual-based model. We ﬁnd that the design of RepCSPResNet [85] also ﬁt our design pat- tern.\\n\\nFigure 7: Reversed CSPDarknet.

We show all comparison results in Table 6. From the results listed in Table 6, it is clear that any model that increases assistant loss can signiﬁcantly improve the overall performance. In addition, our proposed lead guided label assignment strat- egy receives better performance than the general indepen- dent label assignment strategy in AP, AP50, and AP75. As for our proposed coarse for assistant and ﬁne for lead label assignment strategy, it results in best results in all cases. In Figure 8 we show the objectness map predicted by different methods at auxiliary head and lead head. From Figure 8 we ﬁnd that if auxiliary head learns lead guided soft label, it will indeed help lead head to extract the residual informa- tion from the consistant targets.\\n\\nSince the proposed YOLOv7 uses multiple pyramids to jointly predict object detection results, we can directly con- nect auxiliary head to the pyramid in the middle layer for training. This type of training can make up for informa- tion that may be lost in the next level pyramid prediction. For the above reasons, we designed partial auxiliary head in the proposed E-ELAN architecture. Our approach is to connect auxiliary head after one of the sets of feature map before merging cardinality, and this connection can make the weight of the newly generated set of feature map not directly updated by assistant loss. Our design allows each pyramid of lead head to still get information from objects with different sizes. Table 8 shows the results obtained us- ing two different methods, i.e., coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided and partial coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided methods. Obviously, the partial coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided method has a better auxiliary effect.\\n\\nTable 8: Ablation study on partial auxiliary head.\\n\\nModel\\n\\nSize APval APval 50\\n\\nAPval 75\\n\\nTable 6: Ablation study on proposed auxiliary head.\\n\\nModel\\n\\nSize APval APval 50\\n\\nAPval 75\\n\\nbase (v7-E6) independent lead guided coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided improvement\\n\\n1280 1280 1280 1280 -\\n\\n55.6% 73.2% 60.7% 55.8% 73.4% 60.9% 55.9% 73.5% 61.0% 55.9% 73.5% 61.1% +0.4 +0.3 +0.3\\n\\nbase (v7-E6E) aux partial aux improvement\\n\\n6.

That is, we compared the results of with/without the introduction of upper bound constraint. Judging from the numbers in the Table, the method of con- straining the upper bound of objectness by the distance from the center of the object can achieve better performance.\\n\\nIn this paper we propose a new architecture of real- time object detector and the corresponding model scaling method. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the evolving process of object detection methods generates new research top- ics. During the research process, we found the replace- ment problem of re-parameterized module and the alloca- tion problem of dynamic label assignment. To solve the problem, we propose the trainable bag-of-freebies method to enhance the accuracy of object detection. Based on the above, we have developed the YOLOv7 series of object de- tection systems, which receives the state-of-the-art results.\\n\\nTable 7: Ablation study on constrained auxiliary head.\\n\\nModel\\n\\nSize APval APval 50\\n\\nAPval 75\\n\\n7.

For exam- ple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute stick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU (Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI processing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are all NPUs.

Mainly af- ter the above new concepts are proposed, the training of object detector evolves many new issues. In this paper, we will present some of the new issues we have discovered and devise effective methods to address them.

In addition, when we discover that with dynamic label assignment technology, the training of model with multiple output layers will generate new issues.

For the above reasons, we designed partial auxiliary head in the proposed E-ELAN architecture. Our approach is to connect auxiliary head after one of the sets of feature map before merging cardinality, and this connection can make the weight of the newly generated set of feature map not directly updated by assistant loss. Our design allows each pyramid of lead head to still get information from objects with different sizes.

It was first introduced in 2016 by Joseph Redmon et al. and has since been improved upon with newer versions such as YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for applications such as self-driving cars and surveillance systems.'"
